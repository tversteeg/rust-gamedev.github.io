<p>Shifting Chamber (<a href="https://maciekglowka.itch.io/shifting-chamber">itch.io</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/maciekglowka/shifting_chamber">Github</a>) is a simple tactics game where
the player, instead of moving the character, manipulates the map around it.
The goal is to defeat the enemies by forcing them into hazardous
positions - since they cannot be attacked directly.</p>
<p>The game is in an early prototype / proof of concept phase.
It is written with the help of the Bevy engine.
There is currently only a WASM build (freely available on the itch.io)</p>

<p>In the last month, the first <a href="https://github.com/fishfolk/jumpy/releases/tag/v0.6.0">MVP release</a> of Jumpy was made. The
release adds some major new features including a live map editor, critters,
extended player animations, and basic AI. Soon afterward <a href="https://github.com/fishfolk/jumpy/releases/tag/v0.6.1">an update</a>
was made with revised maps and some important bug fixes.</p>
<p>Along with the release is a new blog post, sharing thoughts on some of the lessons
learned during development:
<a href="https://fishfolk.org/blog/jumpy-0-6-retrospective/">Jumpy v0.6 Retrospective</a>.</p>
<p>The efforts are now focused on getting network play implemented, with a two
player LAN proof-of-concept already working. The hope is to get the remaining
network issues fixed and the online matchmaker connected before making another
release as soon as it's ready.</p>

is a &quot;BattleBots&quot; themed robot wars simulator developed using <a href="https://bevyengine.org">Bevy</a>.</p>
<p>The game is planned to have multiple combat arenas.
Each player can compete using their selected robot.
Players will be able to score and win by damaging and destroying opponent robots.
Or by knocking opponents out of the arena.</p>
<p>There are 3 variants of the robots planned as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light Weight &quot;Annoyance&quot;: Low mass/HP, but will be unpredictable and fast.
It will slowly kill by consistently annoying and damaging opponents.</li>
<li>Medium Weight &quot;Sniper&quot;: Medium weight robot that will be equipped with a high boost.
This will allow it to knockout opponents or push them out of the arena.</li>
<li>Heavy Weight &quot;TANK&quot;: Highest mass/HP and momentum.
Slow moving but hard to kill.
Equipped with magnetic wedges that will help pin/push opponents out of the arena.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is currently a work in progress. For updates follow <a href="https://twitter.com/nilay_savant">Nilay Savant</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>In March, culling of underground terrain was added, improving rendering
speeds. There has been a large influx of player growth, which has been rallying
the focus on server optimizations. Optimizations for buffs and auras were added,
specifically around how much network bandwidth is being used. A visual guide of
Veloren was created, which should help onboard new players to the game. It

<p><a href="https://github.com/polymonster/hotline">hotline</a> (<a href="https://polymonster.co.uk">Blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/polymonster">Twitter</a>)
is a modern, high-performance, hot-reload
graphics engine written in Rust. It aims to provide low-level access to modern
graphics API features, while at the same time providing high-level ergonomic
optimizations.</p>
<p>It uses Bevy's ECS so the focus can remain primarily on the graphics
architecture. Direct3D12 is the only supported platform, but the graphics API is
abstracted to account for future ports to Vulkan and Metal. The project is in
its early stages but already has a decent amount of features showcasing
different render strategies, async command buffer generation, plugin based
architecture, and hot-reload support for Rust code, HLSL shaders, and render
configs. It supports ImGui with docking and multiple windows, video decoding,
complex image loading (cubemaps, arrays, volumes), and more.</p>

<em>Video: Talk about writing NES assembly programs in Rust</em></a></p>
<p>This is a talk about writing a program for the Nintendo Entertainment System
that exposes all of its audio processor registers through an interface that lets
the user flip bits using the controller and hear the result in real-time. The
program is written in Rust using an Embedded Domain-Specific Language. The talk
demonstrates the features of the language and how they can be used to help
express NES assembly programs in Rust.</p>
<p>Some features of the EDSL:</p>
<ul>
<li>defining and calling assembly functions by string labels</li>
<li>using Rust as a powerful macro language (e.g. generate code inside a for-loop)</li>
<li>using Rust's type system to catch invalid combinations of instruction and
addressing mode</li>
</ul>
<p>The source code for the NES program described in the talk is
<a href="https://github.com/gridbugs/nes-audio-playground">here</a> and there is a <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=QHoISiWdPXo">demo of the tool on

Thanks to feedback, contributions and crates from the community, it has now

Bevy version lifecycle and do major reworks only in time for new versions.</p>
<p>So, if anyone was eyeing it but was turned off by the frequent big changes or
the lack of some features, now is the time! Version 0.2.0 includes
the following cool new features compared to 0.1.0:</p>
<ul>

makes it possible to set the background and the foreground color of a texture atlas
sprite (built-in Bevy sprites only have a tint property).
This plugin is convenient when using 1-bit tilesets such as <a href="https://mrmotarius.itch.io/mrmotext">MRMOTEXT</a>.</p>
<p>The 0.1 release adds a <code>TextModeTextureAtlasSprite</code> component with
configurable background, foreground, x/y flip and opacity.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/johanhelsing/matchbox">Matchbox</a> is a library for easily establishing unreliable, unordered,
peer-to-peer WebRTC data connections using rust WASM (and native). This enables
cross-platform low-latency multiplayer games.</p>
<p>Previously, the socket opened a single udp-like data channel. In version 0.6,
however, support for adding extra channels with configurable ordering and
package retransmits was added. This enables direct p2p tcp-like connections as
well.</p>
<p>Two new crates were added in this release. matchbox_signaling, lets you
set up a custom signaling server, also supporting client-server topologies,
enabling scenarios where one player acts as the host for the other players.</p>
<p>bevy_matchbox provides ergonomic usage with Bevy. Severely cutting down on the
boiler-plate needed.</p>
<p>The tutorial series on <a href="https://johanhelsing.studio/posts/extreme-bevy">how to make a p2p web game with Bevy, GGRS and
Matchbox</a> was also updated to the latest versions of all three
libraries.</p>

<em>Hot-rebuilding a rust-gpu shader from a bevy app</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevy-rust-gpu">Bevy Rust-GPU</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Shfty">@Shfty</a>
is a suite of crates encoding a practical <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu">rust-gpu</a> workflow for <a href="https://bevyengine.org">bevy</a>.</p>
<p>The latest release brings new GPU interop traits, shader macro robustness,
and compatibility with <a href="https://bevyengine.org">bevy</a> 0.10 and <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu">rust-gpu</a> 0.6.
Further development continues apace, with major improvements to the SPIR-V
interchange pipeline, shader compilation machinery, and support code already merged.</p>
<p>The project is still in development, and presently relies on custom forks
of the associated crates. However, various PRs have been filed upstream
to build out a robust interchange between them, with the hope of mainline compatibility
- and a corresponding crates.io release - sometime in the future.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://github.com/eddyb">@eddyb</a> deserves special thanks for his work on the <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu">rust-gpu</a> side,
which has enabled and informed many of the improvements tabled for the next release,
and greatly accelerated the process of making Rust a viable shading language
for users of Bevy and WGPU.</p>

<em>An implicit surface defined compositionally, raymarched, and shaded entirely
in Rust</em></p>
<p>Announcing <a href="https://github.com/bevy-rust-gpu/rust-gpu-sdf">rust-gpu-sdf</a>, by <a href="https://github.com/Shfty">@Shfty</a>; a no-std signed distance field library
designed for use on both CPU and GPU.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function">Signed distance fields</a> are a powerful computational tool
that allows a surface to be represented by a function from position to distance.
This has <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/raymarchingdf">intuitive applications</a> in various domains such as rendering,
collision, meshing, and volume modeling, providing the means to represent analytically
smooth geometry, dynamic morphing (as pictured), and various other effects
that would traditionally require specialized tools to model.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bevy-rust-gpu/rust-gpu-sdf">rust-gpu-sdf</a> aims to enumerate this domain to the fullest extent allowed
by Rust's type system, lifting its traditionally monolithic implementation style
into a set of intuitive composable operators, and leveraging a natural synergy
with functional programming to provide powerful compositional tools.</p>
<p>Contrary to its working title, <a href="https://github.com/bevy-rust-gpu/rust-gpu-sdf">rust-gpu-sdf</a> is actually <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu">rust-gpu</a>-agnostic,
so can be used anywhere Rust can;
it's presently named as such due to being built as the primary consumer of <a href="https://github.com/bevy-rust-gpu">bevy-rust-gpu</a>,
with a view to providing a performant and compositional way to compile SDFs
into SPIR-V for rendering on the GPU.</p>
<p>It's presently in a heavy-development prerelease state, so watch this space!</p>

</h3>
<p><img src="foxes.jpg" alt="Differently pixelated foxes" /></p>
<p>Jan Hohenheim (<a href="https://github.com/janhohenheim">@janhohenheim</a>) recently published a new crate called <a href="https://github.com/janhohenheim/pixelate_mesh">pixelate_mesh</a>.
It is a Bevy plugin that provides a Pixelate component that one can add to any
entity holding a mesh or a scene, which it will then pixelate without any post-processing.
The idea is to recreate the effect seen in <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Vb-hPYOIwMw">Prodeus</a>.</p>
