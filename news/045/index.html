<p>Welcome to the 45th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
<a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

The meetups take place on the second Saturday of every month via the <a href="https://discord.gg/yNtPTb2">Rust

<p>Voting on the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3">Bevy Jam 3</a> has finished! It was a
week-long event, where the goal was to make a game in
<a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy Engine</a>, the free and open-source game engine
built in Rust. The theme was 'Side Effects'.</p>

<p>Another Rusty Jam starts on May 21st!</p>
<p>It's a great chance to try out some new Rusty tech, form a team of like-minded rustaceans,
and feel what a full cycle of making a game in Rust feels like in miniature!</p>
<p>This jam focuses more on using Rust than anything else.
That means you aren't restricted on your design, music, or graphics,
as long as you use Rust to make it!</p>
<p>The optional-to-use theme for the jam is going to be announced
in <a href="https://discord.gg/8dUQJFFmxG">the jam's Discord</a> and pinned in the community section.
While you're waiting for the theme, you can start looking for a team
in the looking-for-team Discord channel.
If you want solo though, that's fine too.</p>

shooting lasers and lighting statues to solve puzzles.</p>
<p>In each level, you have to configure mirrors, lasers, and other items
to light up all the statues while avoiding any mishaps like shooting
yourself with a laser beam.</p>
<p>There's only 4 core levels right now but in addition to adding more
the developer is working on a repository system where web servers
can host level files and users can subscribe to them.</p>

<em>A 10-second preview of what's possible with Ambient 0.2</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ambient.run/post/ambient-0-2">Ambient 0.2</a> is now out after two months of development.
Ambient is an open-source runtime for building high-performance multiplayer
games and 3D applications powered by WebAssembly, Rust and WebGPU. Projects
consist of assets and logic built around the currently Rust-only Ambient API,
and these projects can be loaded by any compatible runtime running on any
platform.</p>
<p>This release brings a few major features, including basic support for playing
sounds, being able to run WASM on the client (in addition to the server), and
automatic proxying of servers by the Ambient Proxy. This allows anyone with
the URL to connect to a server, without having to worry about port forwarding.</p>
<p>Finally, Ambient UI can now be used from guest code. Combined with networking
and ECS, this unlocks an exciting new capability: multiplayer UI! The blog post
walks through the creation of a basic multiplayer beat sequencer using these
features.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/AmbientRun/Ambient">the GitHub</a> to get started with building for/or
on Ambient yourself, or chat with the developers and other explorers on
<a href="https://discord.gg/ambient">the Discord</a>.</p>

<a href="https://godot-rust.github.io">a reworked website</a>. The site acts as a hub to all the relevant
resources and community platforms. It also hosts auto-generated API docs

<p><a href="https://edgardocarreras.com/blog/tdd-in-rust-game-engine-bevy">Edgardo Carreras writes about his experience</a> with Test-Driven Development
while developing a game engine in Rust using Bevy. TDD is an iterative software
development approach that involves writing automated tests before writing the code.
In the article, Edgardo explains the benefits of TDD and how it can help in game
development. He also shares his testing process, including how he used Bevy's ECS
architecture to write tests for his game engine.</p>

<p><img src="bevy_roguelike.gif" alt="a couple characters moving around and interacting" /></p>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@maciekglowka">@maciekglowka</a> started a blog series on creating a
roguelike game using Bevy Engine.
There are currently seven parts, focusing mostly on setting up a basic
game architecture. The topics discussed so far include: separating logic from
graphics in the ECS; designing a turn-based game loop; command pattern
for the unit actions.</p>

Ryosuke's goal was to create a game inspired by Katamari Damacy, an old
PlayStation 2 game. In the game, a prince rollsup objects to make planet
sized balls.
Ryosuke shares their <a href="https://whoisryosuke.com/blog/2023/making-katamari-for-bevy-game-jam">learning process</a> of the almost-finished

<p>Rustracer, a PBR <a href="https://www.khronos.org/gltf">glTF 2.0</a> renderer based on Vulkan ray-tracing.
It can render (almost) any glTF 2.0 scene by pure path tracing
at an interactive speed.
Compared with rasterization-based glTF renderers, Rustracer needs some
(scene-dependent) time for sample accumulation in exchange for global illumination.</p>
<p>On top of that, the control panel provides a rich set of viewing options
and debugging utilities.</p>
<p>It also can serve as a glTF viewer or a reference renderer.</p>

of the RPG Maker editor, based mostly off of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/235900/RPG_Maker_XP">RPG Maker XP</a>
(aka RMXP), with the intent of creating a more modern, feature rich,
and open source version of RMXP.</p>
<p>RGSS, RMXP's runtime, has already been open sourced thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Ancurio/mkxp">mkxp</a>.
However, despite several attempts, no one has fully remade the editor.
There are <a href="https://github.com/20kdc/gabien-app-r48">some tools</a> out there that cover some of its functionality,
but none are user friendly, nor feature complete.</p>
<p>RGSS is actually quite enjoyable to use. The actual editor though - not so much:
dated and often unintuitive UI, extensibility issues,
binary format that is allergic to source control,
and arbitrary limits that never existed in previous versions.
Luminol was born out of sheer frustration from dealing with these issues -
and hopes to fix them!</p>
<p>Luminol's key differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely GPU accelerated (RMXP is software rendered).</li>
<li>Edit multiple maps at the same time.</li>
<li>Multiple data formats.</li>
<li>Edit encrypted archives (rgssad).</li>
<li>Open-source.</li>
<li>Better user experience overall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luminol is currently looking for contributors:
<a href="https://github.com/Astrabit-ST/Luminol/issues">there is a lot to be done</a>.

<p>The project is not affiliated or related to Blockchain/NFTs:
it uses a PostgreSQL DB to store users, games and items.
Authentication is done via email/password,
third party authentication via OAuth will be a future goal.
An Authenticated user can create apps and add item definitions to these.
Other users can get an independent instance of that item and modify its data.</p>
