<p>Welcome to the 41st issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
<a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

You play the role of a knight and protect the temple from raiding automatons.</p>
<p>What began as an experiment to learn game dev in Rust using <a href="https://bevyengine.org">Bevy</a>.
Initially motivated by the visual appeal of a <a href="https://twitter.com/nilay_savant/status/1568307034390675456">scene running in the browser via WASM</a>.
It quickly started taking the shape of a game:</p>
<ul>
<li>From adding <a href="https://rapier.rs/">Rapier</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/nilay_savant/status/1569665425046384641">basic physics</a> to developing mechanics for other entities.</li>
<li>Path finding for Automaton's using <a href="https://twitter.com/nilay_savant/status/1573783227911012352">control systems</a>.</li>
<li>Which was later switched to a deterministic <a href="https://twitter.com/nilay_savant/status/1574735050809413633">A-start navmesh approach</a>.</li>
<li>Developed mechanics for the player controller including the first-person-camera.</li>
<li>Implemented weapon + projectiles systems.</li>
<li>Finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/nilay_savant/status/1607115041253519361">custom shaders for projectiles</a> were added as a finishing touch.</li>
</ul>
<p>An experiment that became the first game published by <a href="https://github.com/nilaysavant">@nilaysavant</a>.

<p>Johan wrote <a href="https://johanhelsing.studio/posts/cargo-space-devlog-0">an introductory post</a> about the design idea,
and a tentative plan for its development.</p>
<p>The first step was to make an initial offline single-player prototype. This is
covered in the <a href="https://johanhelsing.studio/posts/cargo-space-devlog-1">first devlog</a> along with topics such as
procedural generation, 2d platforming, bloom, and various community Bevy crates,
such as <a href="https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap">bevy_ecs_tilemap</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Trouv/bevy_ecs_ldtk">bevy_ecs_ldtk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/abnormalbrain/bevy_particle_systems">bevy_particle_systems</a>.</p>
<p>The procedural generation needs for the game also resulted in a new crate being born.
<a href="https://github.com/johanhelsing/noisy_bevy">noisy_bevy</a> is a CPU and GPU noise plugin for Bevy.</p>
<p>After this, p2p rollback networking was added using <a href="https://github.com/gschup/bevy_ggrs">bevy_ggrs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/johanhelsing/matchbox">Matchbox</a>.
The <a href="https://johanhelsing.studio/posts/cargo-space-devlog-2">second devlog</a> goes through this in detail, and in
particular how integration between <a href="https://github.com/gschup/bevy_ggrs">bevy_ggrs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/leafwing-input-manager">leafwing_input_manager</a> was

<p>Last month, an artist joined ThousandthStar to create art for the game.
A testing server has now been set up
(more information is in the <a href="https://discord.gg/NbBcF4bGU5">Discord</a> server).</p>

lots of effort is being put into their wings. Some UI elements have changed
location, both the bag and spellbook buttons were merged with other button bars.</p>
<p>Frost Gigas are another big item in the works. These creatures will be Veloren's
world boss. Gigas will hopefully be the first of a numerous elemental giants to
roam the open world of Veloren and will need a large group of players to be able
to take it down and collect it's new uncraftable and legendary loot!</p>

<p>In the last month, work started on a new architecture for the core Jumpy game loop.</p>
<p>Determinism and snapshot/restore functionality has been a challenge for
networking support in jumpy. To address this, Jumpy has started migrating the core
game loop to a custom, micro Entity Component System that is deterministic and can
be trivially snapshot and restored.</p>
<p>By being simple and planning to eventually support a pure C API, it's also
intended for the micro-ECS approach to make it vastly easier to create a
performant modding interface to Jumpy in the future.</p>
<p>Work has almost been finished on the new Bones ECS and the surrounding <a href="https://github.com/fishfolk/bones">Bones</a>
framework, which is still built on Bevy for rendering and otherwise talking to
the hardware. The hope is that Bones can become a framework for making other
games similar in scope to Jumpy, without those games have to re-invent everything
that was needed to get features like UI, networking, localization, asset loading,
etc.</p>
<p>As soon as the ECS migration is finished, the plan is to get the final game juicing
and polish done and to make a proper MVP release.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/google/forma">forma</a> by google is a (thoroughly) parallelized experimental
Rust vector-graphics renderer with both a software (CPU) and hardware (GPU)
back-end having the <a href="https://github.com/google/forma#readme">goals</a> of portability, performance, simplicity,
and minimal size.
Forma relies on Rust's SIMD auto-vectorization/intrinsics and <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon">Rayon</a>
to have good performance on the CPU,
while using <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb">WebGPU</a> (<a href="https://wgpu.rs/">wgpu</a>) to take advantage of the GPU.</p>
<p>A few implementation highlights that make the library stand out
from commonly used vector renderers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Curvature-aware flattening.
All higher cubic BÃ©ziers are approximated by quadratic ones, then,
in parallel, flattened to line segments according to their curvature.
This <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/graphics/curves/2019/12/23/flatten-quadbez.html">technique</a> was developed by Raph Levien.</li>
<li>Cheap translations and rotations.
Translations and rotations can be rendered without having
to re-flatten the curves, all the while maintaining full quality.</li>
<li>Parallel pixel grid intersection.
Line segments are transformed into pixel segments by intersecting them
with the pixel grid. We developed a simple method that performs this computation
in O(1) and which is run in parallel.</li>
<li>Efficient sorting.
We ported <a href="https://github.com/google/crumsort-rs">crumsort</a> to Rust and parallelized it with Rayon, delivering
improved performance over its pdqsort implementation for 64-bit random data.
Scattering pixel segments with a sort was inspired from Allan MacKinnon's work
on <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/graphics/lib/compute/spinel">Spinel</a>.</li>
<li>Update only the tiles that change (currently CPU-only).
We implemented a fail-fast per-tile optimizer that tries to skip
the painting step entirely. A similar approach could also be tested on the GPU.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While Forma is a general-purpose library it can be an interesting building block
for vector-based games and engines (see the <a href="https://github.com/google/forma/blob/681e8bfd3/demo/src/demos/spaceship.rs">spaceship demo</a>
