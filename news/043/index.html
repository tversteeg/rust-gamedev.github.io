<a href="https://mastodon.social/@johanhelsing">@johanhelsing</a> is a co-op 2d space game where you build
a ship and fly it through space looking for new parts, fighting pirates and the
environment.</p>
<p>The game uses its own homemade XPBD-based physics engine implemented directly
using <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">Bevy</a> systems and types. This month the implementation was fleshed out
adding important features such as collision layers, composite colliders, one-way
platforms, and an efficient collision broadphase.</p>
<p>In other words, this means ship-to-ship collisions are finally happening. This
was previously tricky, since ships are a combination of box colliders when
colliding with each other and bevy_ecs_tilemap colliders (when colliding with
the player).</p>
<p>One part of the broadphase implementation was split out into a new crate,
<a href="https://github.com/johanhelsing/bevy_sparse_grid_2d">bevy_sparse_grid_2d</a>. It provides a simple and convenient way to query for
entities that share one or more grid cells based on their axis-aligned bounding
box (AABB).</p>

<p>Legend of Worlds uses Toxoid Engine. Toxoid is a cross-platform, polyglot,
open-source WebAssembly game engine written in Rust.
The architecture has been updated so that Toxoid games can now share memory
directly between WASM components, and map access to the data values rather than
deserializing a set of values every time, resulting in &quot;massive performance gains&quot;.</p>

almost 3 years of development.</p>
<p>The game is written completely in Rust, using a custom engine based on
DirectX 11, physics powered by Rapier-3D.</p>
<p>Stefano Casillo, programmer commented: &quot;Rust delivered on every single
promise. I never experienced such an uneventful launch and QA as the one
we had for Hydrofoil Generation. The software stability has been impressive
since the beginning of the project and confirmed the trend at release with
very few problems all very easy to address&quot;.</p>
<p>Hydrofoil Generation currently sits at a very positive review rate of 96%
on the Steam page and is praised for its challenging gameplay, performance

<ul>
<li>Support for arrays, packed arrays, and dictionaries</li>

portable graphics engine built to make it easier to render 2D or 3D graphics.</p>
<p>Although the month of Febuary was slow for the development of the engine, there
have been significant efforts towards the addition of <a href="https://docs.rs/blue_engine">documentation</a>
and the eventual release of the next version. In the meantime,
the plugins have favored significant updates and development in the month,
notably the <a href="https://github.com/AryanpurTech/BlueEngineEGUI">egui</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Now the <a href="https://github.com/AryanpurTech/BlueEngineEGUI">egui plugin</a> allow you to render objects of the engine direction
inside an egui window. This feature was built in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/TheNoswad">@Noswad</a>.</p>
<p>This also introduced a new option in Objects: <code>is_visible: bool</code>
which hides an object
from getting rendered if set to false (set to <code>true</code> as default). This allows
you to hide an object from getting rendered on the background of egui, and can then
add it to be rendered inside an egui window instead. So far the system on the second
design, suggestions are welcome to cement a better design. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/AryanpurTech/BlueEngineEGUI/blob/master/examples/custom_3d.rs">example</a>.</p>

rich multiplayer worlds and experiences.</p>
<p>It is guided by several core principles, including seamless networking,
data-oriented design, interoperability, and more.
The core runtime is written in Rust and uses WGPU for graphics, Quinn
for networking, and WebAssembly for user logic. This allows it to run on
all major desktop platforms, with active work underway for the Web and

<p><a href="https://github.com/kuviman/geng">Geng</a> by <a href="https://github.com/kuviman">@kuviman</a> is a game engine that is used by him &amp; friends
for mostly making small games for game jams.</p>
<p>The focus is to work on the web first (using WebGL1),
but can also work easily on native platforms.</p>
<p>Font rendering is done using sdf textures,
which are being created on GPU based on <a href="https://astiopin.github.io/2019/01/06/sdf-on-gpu.html">this article</a>.
Some font improvements from February:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better curve approximation (still can be done better like in the article).</li>
<li>Use euclidean distance instead of manhattan.</li>
<li>Added a method to create sdf texture for text.
(previously font only had sdf texture atlas with every glyph).</li>
</ul>
<p>Support was added for OpenGL blend equations - e.g. minmax blending,
which is now used instead of depth buffer for sdf textures</p>
<p>Also, some improvements related to sound:
API to query <code>Sound</code> duration,
starting sound playback from specific position,
and changing the speed of <code>SoundEffect</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/blink-alloc">blink-alloc</a> is a brand new arena-allocator with bunch of improvements
over existing solutions that is
tested with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> and follows <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228">&quot;Strict Provenance Rules&quot;</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arena-allocators offer extremely fast allocations and deallocations.
Allocation is just a few pointer arithmetic operations.
And deallocation is nearly no-op.
In exchange arena-allocator requires a point in time when all
previous allocations are unused to reset state.<br />
Rust's borrow-checker ensures the requirement for reset making
it 100% safe to use.</p>
<p>TL;DR great for games, servers, cli tools, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>blink-alloc provides thread-local and multi-threaded allocators -
<code>BlinkAlloc</code> and <code>SyncBlinkAlloc</code>.
Single-threaded version <a href="https://github.com/zakarumych/blink-alloc/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md">performs many times faster than <code>bumpalo</code></a>.
The author couldn't find another implementation to compare
the multi-threaded version's performance.</p>
<p>It also provided out-of-the-box to fetch <code>BlinkAlloc</code> in task/thread
and return it back when done, keeping multiple <code>BlinkAlloc</code> instances warmed.</p>
<p>On top of raw allocations blink-alloc provides <code>Blink</code> type
that works as safe allocator adaptor.
<code>Blink</code> can allocate memory and initialize it with values provided by user.
Users may provide values as-is, as closures, or as iterators.
<code>Blink</code>'s API is safe with few exceptions for niche use cases.</p>
<p>Those familiar with <code>bumpalo</code> may think of <code>Blink</code> as of <code>bumpalo::Bump</code>.
Though <code>Blink</code></p>
<ul>
<li>drops all placed values on reset,
which makes it usable with any kind of types without resource leaks.</li>
<li>Accepts any iterator type, not just <code>ExactSizeIterator</code> implementations.</li>
<li>Is configurable to use any <code>BlinkAllocator</code> implementation, thus not
tied to <code>Global</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, Rust's standard collection types may use custom allocators
only one nightly and with <code>allocator_api</code> feature enabled.
blink-alloc uses <code>allocator-api2</code> crate to work on both stable and nightly.
Integration with other crates is simple and doesn't require depending on
blink-alloc, only on <code>allocator-api2</code>.</p>

<em>Promise chaining example</em></p>
<p>In the ECS environment, you can't use the standard async/await
approach, which can make implementing asynchronous logic painful.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jkb0o/pecs">pecs</a> is a plugin for the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">Bevy</a> engine that solves this problem.
It allows you to execute the code asynchronously by chaining multiple
promises as part of <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs">Bevy's <code>ecs</code></a> environment.</p>
<p>Each promise takes the state and result of the previous promise as arguments,
as well as any Bevy ECS system parameter, and passes the modified
state and new promise/result to the next promise. It's easy to register custom
promises that wait for user input, events, asset loading, and so on. You can
also use <a href="https://github.com/jkb0o/pecs">pecs</a> to wait for any or all of multiple promises to complete
before continuing with the rest of the code, as well as to loop asynchronously
until a condition is met.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Seldom-SE/seldom_state">seldom_state</a> is a Bevy plugin that adds a <code>StateMachine</code> component that you
can add to your entities. The state machine will change the entity's components
based on states, triggers, and transitions that you define. It's useful
for player controllers, animations, simple AI, etc.</p>
<p>This month <a href="https://github.com/Seldom-SE/seldom_state">seldom_state</a> 0.4 has been released:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transition builders (<code>StateMachine::trans_builder</code>) which let you pass data
from triggers to states.</li>
<li>The <code>AnyState</code> state, which you can use wherever <code>StateMachine</code> accepts state
type parameters, which lets you create transitions from any state, etc</li>
<li>A <code>leafwing_input</code> feature for <code>leafwing-input-manager</code> integration,
which enables 9 built-in triggers related to input. <code>JustPressedTrigger</code>,
for example.</li>
<li><code>OptionTrigger</code> and <code>BoolTrigger</code> traits, which are simpler to implement
